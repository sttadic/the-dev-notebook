## üî∞ Getting Started

### Initialize a New Local Repository

```bash
git init    # Starts version control in your current directory (creates .git folder)
```

### Clone a Remote Repository (using GitHub Token)

```bash
git clone https://<token>@github.com/username/repo-name.git  # Clones a repo and sets origin remote with authentication via token
```

## üíª Local Workflow

### Check Repo Status

```bash
git status    # Shows staged, unstaged, and untracked files
```

### Stage Files

```bash
git add <file>      # Stage specific file
git add .           # Stage all changes
```

### Commit Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"                  # Save staged changes with a message
git commit --amend -m "Updated message"         # Modify last commit (if not pushed)
```

### Unstage a File

```bash
git reset <file>  # Removes file from staging area but keeps local changes
```

### Discard Changes

```bash
git restore <file>       # Restore single file to last commit
git restore .            # Restore all files to last commit
git checkout -- <file>   # Legacy alternative to restore a file
```

### View Changes

```bash
git diff               # View unstaged changes
git diff --staged      # View staged changes
git diff HEAD          # View all changes since last commit
```

### View Commit History

```bash
git log                # Full commit history
git log --oneline      # Compact view of commit history
```

## üåê Remote Repositories

### Add Remote

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git  # Add remote repository named 'origin'
```

### Push Commits

```bash
git push -u origin main  # First push, sets upstream
git push                 # Push subsequent commits
```

### Pull Changes

```bash
git pull  # Fetches and merges remote changes into current branch
```

### Fetch Changes (without merge)

```bash
git fetch               # Get changes from remote without merging
git fetch --prune       # Remove remote-tracking branches that no longer exist
```

---

<br>

## üåø Branching & Collaboration

### List Branches

```bash
git branch             # Show local branches
git branch -r          # Show remote branches
git branch -a          # Show all branches
```

### Create a New Branch

```bash
git branch feature-xyz  # Create a new branch called feature-xyz
```

### Switch to a Branch

```bash
git switch feature-xyz       # Switch to branch (modern)
git checkout feature-xyz     # Switch to branch (legacy)
```

### Create and Switch in One Command

```bash
git switch -c feature-xyz        # Create & switch (modern)
git checkout -b feature-xyz      # Create & switch (legacy)
```

### Switch and Track a Remote Branch Locally

```bash
git switch --track origin/feature-xyz            # Modern
git checkout -b feature-xyz origin/feature-xyz   # Legacy
```

### Merge a Branch into Current

```bash
git merge feature-xyz   # Merge feature-xyz into current branch
```

### Delete a Branch

```bash
git branch -d feature-xyz       # Safe delete (if already merged)
git branch -D feature-xyz       # Force delete
```

## üì¶ Stashing Work

### Stash Changes

```bash
git stash  # Temporarily save changes without committing
```

### List Stashes

```bash
git stash list  # View saved stashes
```

### Apply Most Recent Stash (keep in stash)

```bash
git stash apply  # Apply latest stash but keep it in the list
```

### Apply and Remove Most Recent Stash

```bash
git stash pop  # Apply and remove latest stash from list
```

### Remove a Specific Stash

```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}  # Delete specific stash by index
```

---

<br>

## üîß Advanced & Useful Commands

### Visualize Commit Graph

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all  # View commit tree across branches
```

### Remove a File from Git But Keep Locally

```bash
git rm --cached <file>  # Stop tracking a file but keep it locally
```

### Tag a Version

```bash
git tag v1.0.0          # Create tag locally
git push origin v1.0.0  # Push tag to remote
```

### Ignore Changes to a Tracked File (Locally)

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>  # Temporarily ignore file changes
```

### Start Tracking Ignored File Again

```bash
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>  # Start tracking changes again
```

### Skip Worktree (useful for config/env files in local dev)

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree <file>  # Don't touch this file during merges/pulls
```

### Unset Skip Worktree

```bash
git update-index --no-skip-worktree <file>  # Resume normal tracking
```

### Restore All Working Files to Last Commit

```bash
git restore .  # Reset all changes in working directory
```

---

<br>

## üßº Cleanup

### Delete Local Branch That No Longer Exists on Remote

```bash
git fetch --prune  # Clean up local references to deleted remote branches
```

### Delete All Local Branches Gone from Remote (advanced)

```bash
git remote prune origin  # Aggressively clean up remote-tracking branches
```

Use with caution ‚Äî removes all remote-tracking branches no longer on the remote.

## üîÑ `git fetch` vs `git pull`

Understanding the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull` is key to safely managing updates from a remote repository.

| Command     | Description                                                                                                                | Merges Changes? | Safe to Use Without Side Effects? |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `git fetch` | Downloads commits, branches, tags, etc. from the remote, but **does not** change your working directory or current branch. | ‚ùå No           | ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äì read-only                |
| `git pull`  | **Fetches** changes from the remote **and merges** them into your current branch.                                          | ‚úÖ Yes          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not always ‚Äì might auto-merge  |

---

### üîç `git fetch` in Detail

```bash
git fetch origin
```

- Downloads updates from the remote (e.g., new commits or branches).
- Local branches stay unchanged until you explicitly merge or rebase.

Inspect remote updates before applying:

```bash
git log HEAD..origin/main       # View new commits
git diff HEAD origin/main       # View code differences
```

Manually integrate changes:

```bash
git merge origin/main           # Merge into current branch
git rebase origin/main          # Rebase onto updated branch
```

---

### üîç `git pull` in Detail

```bash
git pull origin main
```

- Combines `fetch` and an immediate `merge` (or `rebase`, if configured).
- Updates your current branch automatically with remote changes.

---

### ‚úÖ When to Use Which?

- **Use `git fetch`** when:

  - You want to preview changes before merging.
  - You're in the middle of work and don't want automatic merges.

- **Use `git pull`** when:
  - You‚Äôre ready to bring in and integrate the latest changes.
  - You trust the remote to be in sync and want to avoid manual steps.

---

üìù **Tip**: Set pull to use rebase instead of merge (for cleaner history):

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase true
```

## üå≤ Git Worktree ‚Äì Multi-Working Directory Guide

`git worktree` allows you to manage multiple working directories from a single Git repository, ideal for working on multiple branches simultaneously, comparing code, or parallel development.

### üîß Basic Commands

```bash
git worktree list                                # List all active worktrees
git worktree add ../dir-name branch-name         # Add a new worktree with specified branch
git worktree add ../dir-name -b new-branch       # Create and switch to a new branch in worktree
git worktree remove ../dir-name                  # Remove a worktree safely
git worktree prune                               # Clean up references to deleted worktrees
```
