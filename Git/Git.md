git push                 # Push subsequent commits
```

### Pull Changes

```bash
git pull  # Fetches and merges remote changes into current branch
```

### Fetch Changes (without merge)

## üåø Branching & Collaboration

### List Branches

```bash
git branch             # Show local branches
git branch -r          # Show remote branches
git branch -a          # Show all branches
```

### Create a New Branch

```bash
git branch feature-xyz  # Create a new branch called feature-xyz
```

### Switch to a Branch

```bash
git switch feature-xyz       # Switch to branch (modern)
git checkout feature-xyz     # Switch to branch (legacy)
```

### Create and Switch in One Command

```bash
git switch -c feature-xyz        # Create & switch (modern)
git checkout -b feature-xyz      # Create & switch (legacy)
```

### Switch and Track a Remote Branch Locally

```bash
git switch --track origin/feature-xyz            # Modern
git checkout -b feature-xyz origin/feature-xyz   # Legacy
```

### Merge a Branch into Current

```bash
git merge feature-xyz   # Merge feature-xyz into current branch
```

### Delete a Branch

```bash
git branch -d feature-xyz       # Safe delete (if already merged)
git branch -D feature-xyz       # Force delete
```

## üì¶ Stashing Work

### Stash Changes

```bash
git stash  # Temporarily save changes without committing
```

### List Stashes

```bash

```bash
git stash apply  # Apply latest stash but keep it in the list
```

### Apply and Remove Most Recent Stash

```bash
git stash pop  # Apply and remove latest stash from list
```

### Remove a Specific Stash

```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}  # Delete specific stash by index
```

## üîß Advanced & Useful Commands

### Visualize Commit Graph

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all  # View commit tree across branches
```

### Remove a File from Git But Keep Locally

```bash
git rm --cached <file>  # Stop tracking a file but keep it locally
```

### Tag a Version

```bash
git tag v1.0.0          # Create tag locally
git push origin v1.0.0  # Push tag to remote
```
