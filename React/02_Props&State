# 🎁 Props in React

**Props**, short for _properties_, are how data is passed **from parent components to child components** in React. If components are JavaScript functions, props are simply the _arguments_ passed into them.

Props make components **customizable** and **reusable**.

---

## 📦 Passing Props into a Component

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Greeting name="Stjepan" />
<Greeting name="Ava" />
```

Each call to `<Greeting />` passes a different `name` prop, allowing the same component to render different content.

---

## 🧑‍🔧 Destructuring Props

Instead of accessing `props.name`, you can destructure props directly in the parameter list:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
	return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

This is a cleaner, more concise syntax — especially with multiple props.

---

## 💡 Props Are Read-Only

Props **cannot be modified** inside the child component — they are immutable from the child’s perspective. Think of them like function arguments: you use them, but you don’t change them.

---

## 🧩 Composing Components with Props

Props can be any data type — strings, numbers, arrays, functions, even components:

```jsx
function Button({ label, onClick }) {
	return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
}

function App() {
	function handleClick() {
		alert("Button was clicked!");
	}

	return <Button label="Click me" onClick={handleClick} />;
}
```

Here, we’re passing both a string (`label`) and a function (`onClick`) as props — giving full control to the parent.

---

## 🧠 Recap

- Props are inputs to components.
- They're passed from parent to child via JSX attributes.
- They’re **read-only** and **help build dynamic UIs**.
- Destructuring makes code more readable.

# 🧠 State in React

While **props** allow components to receive data from the _outside_, **state** allows components to store and manage data _internally_.

State represents information that can **change over time** — whether based on user input, data from an API, or some internal logic.

---

## 🧰 Declaring State with `useState`

React provides the `useState` Hook to give functional components their own internal memory.

### 🧪 Example: A Simple Counter

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<p>You clicked {count} times.</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```

---

## 🔍 What’s Happening Here?

- `useState(0)` creates a **piece of state**, with:
  - `count`: current value (starts at 0)
  - `setCount`: function to update it
- Clicking the button calls `setCount(count + 1)` — causing the component to re-render with the new value.

You can call `useState` **multiple times** in a single component — each call creates a separate slice of state.

---

## 💡 Rules of `useState`

- `useState` **must** be called at the top level of your component — not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Setting state causes the component to **re-render** with the new value.
- State updates are **asynchronous**. React may batch them for performance -> batch multiple re-renders (multiple different state changes) into one for optimization. Example:

  ```jsx
  function Tester() {
  	const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

  	const updateState = () => {
  		setValue(1);
  		setValue(2);
  		setValue(3);
  		console.log("After setState calls, value is still:", value); // 0
  	};

  	return <button onClick={updateState}>Test</button>;
  }
  ```

  React will ignore the first two setValue calls and just use the last one — because they happened synchronously in one block. So it batches them and only uses the last one.
  We can use useEffect hook which runs after component has re-rendered with the updated state to see updated value.

---

## 🧩 Reactivity in Action

```jsx
function WelcomeBanner() {
	const [name, setName] = useState("");

	return (
		<div>
			<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
			<p>Welcome, {name || "guest"}!</p>
		</div>
	);
}
```

As the user types into the input, the `name` state updates in real time — and so does the rendered message.

---

## 🧠 Props vs. State (Quick Recap)

| Feature  | Props                        | State                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Source   | Passed in by parent          | Managed within the component |
| Mutable? | Read-only                    | Mutable via state setters    |
| Purpose  | Configure component behavior | Track internal data changes  |

> With `props` for input and `state` for interactivity, components can now _react_ (pun intended) to both external and internal data — the real power of React!

# 🧬 Deeper Dive into State with `useState`

So far, we’ve seen how `useState` handles basic values like numbers or strings. But real-world applications often involve **objects**, **arrays**, and **more nuanced patterns**. Let’s explore them!

---

## 📦 Storing Objects in State

You can store entire objects as state values — but updates must preserve the rest of the object to avoid overwriting it.

```jsx
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "Stjepan", age: 30 });
// Updater (callback) form is recommended for updating state based on previous state
function updateName(newName) {
	setUser((prevUser) => ({
		...prevUser,
		name: newName,
	}));
}
```

#### ✅ Why use the callback (updater) form?

It guarantees you're working with the **latest**, most up-to-date state, even when updates are batched or queued.

#### ❌ Avoid this (non-callback form):

```jsx
function updateName(newName) {
	const updatedUser = { ...user, name: newName }; // BAD: This captures the current value of `user` at the time this function runs.
	setUser(updatedUser);
}
```

⚠️ Why? If multiple updates happen in a row (queued), they may overwrite each other
because they all use the same (possibly stale) `user` value.

Imagine this (when multiple updates happen in quick succession):

```js
function updateNameAndAge() {
	updateName("Ana");
	updateAge(31);
}

function updateName(newName) {
	setUser({ ...user, name: newName }); // ❌ user is stale here
}

function updateAge(newAge) {
	setUser({ ...user, age: newAge }); // ❌ same issue here
}
```

Each `setUser(...)` call is based on the **same old `user` object** — so one of the updates will **overwrite** the other. For example:

- First call sets: `{ name: "Ana", age: 30 }`
- Second call sets: `{ name: "Stjepan", age: 31 }`

❗ **Result:** Only one update "wins", the other is lost. 😱

---

## 📋 Storing Arrays in State

Use `useState` to manage lists, like a to-do app:

```jsx
const [todos, setTodos] = useState(["Buy milk", "Walk dog"]);

function addTodo(newTodo) {
	setTodos((prevTodos) => [...prevTodos, newTodo]);
}
```

This creates a **new array** instead of mutating the old one — an important rule when using React state: **immutability matters** for detecting changes.

---

## ♻️ Updating Items in an Array

```jsx
function toggleComplete(index) {
	setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.map((todo, i) => (i === index ? `✅ ${todo}` : todo)));
}
```

You use `map` to create a new array, applying a change only to the item at the given index.

---

## 🧠 Derived State vs. Real State

**Derived state** means computing a value during rendering rather than storing it explicitly.

```jsx
function CartSummary({ items }) {
	const total = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
	return <p>Total: ${total}</p>;
}
```

You **don’t need** to store `total` in state — it’s derived from `items`.

### ✅ Tip:

Avoid duplicating state if it can be calculated from props or other state. This reduces bugs and ensures consistency.

---

## 🧪 Initial State from Props

You can initialize state from props — just be careful not to _sync_ them unless you handle updates explicitly:

```jsx
function Profile({ defaultName }) {
	const [name, setName] = useState(defaultName);

	return <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

Once set, `name` becomes independent from `defaultName`.

# 🧩 Custom Hooks and Lifting State Up

---

## 🛠️ Custom Hooks: Reusing Stateful Logic

Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are built-in, but **you can make your own hooks** to share stateful logic between components.

### 🔹 When to Use a Custom Hook

- If several components need to use the same piece of logic (e.g., fetching data, managing forms, handling timers, etc.), a custom hook is perfect.
  > Why? Hooks encapsulate logic, not UI. This keeps your components DRY and readable. <br>
      Example use cases: useForm(), useAuth(), useFetch(), useDebounce(), etc.
- If a component becomes bloated with complex useEffect, useState, or business logic, move the logic into a custom hook.
  > Result: More readable component + isolated logic = better maintainability.
- Custom hooks can be unit tested independently of UI.
  > This is harder to do with HOCs or render props, where logic and rendering are more tightly coupled.

### 🔧 Example: useWindowWidth

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useWindowWidth() {
	const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

	useEffect(() => {
		function handleResize() {
			setWidth(window.innerWidth);
		}

		window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
		return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
	}, []);

	return width;
}
```

Now you can reuse this in any component:

```jsx
function Banner() {
	const width = useWindowWidth();
	return <p>Window width: {width}px</p>;
}
```

### ✅ Naming Convention

Custom hooks **must start with `use`**, so React knows they're hooks and can apply rules correctly.

---

## 🔝 Lifting State Up: Sharing Between Siblings

Sometimes, **two or more components need access to the same state**. Instead of duplicating it, you “lift” the state to their **common parent**.

### 🎯 Example

```jsx
function Parent() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<Display count={count} />
			<IncrementButton onIncrement={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
		</div>
	);
}

function Display({ count }) {
	return <p>Count: {count}</p>;
}

function IncrementButton({ onIncrement }) {
	return <button onClick={onIncrement}>+1</button>;
}
```

- `count` lives in `Parent`
- It's passed **down** to `Display` and `IncrementButton` as props
- `Display` shows the value; `IncrementButton` updates it

This avoids conflicts, duplication, or sync issues between sibling components.

## 🧠 Summary

| Pattern      | Purpose                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Custom Hook  | Reuse logic across components         |
| Lifted State | Share state across sibling components |

> With custom hooks, logic becomes portable; with lifted state, data becomes shared. Together, they help React scale beautifully.
