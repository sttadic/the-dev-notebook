### 1. Writing a Dockerfile: Base Structure

```Dockerfile
# Use a base image (specify Node version and distro)
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy app source code
COPY . .

# Build app (for React/Node frontends)
RUN npm run build

# Expose port (if running a server inside container)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start app (adjust depending on your app start script)
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

### 2. Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t physio-log-frontend:latest .
```

- `docker build`: Build Docker image from Dockerfile in current directory (`.`)
- `-t physio-log-frontend:latest`: Tag the image for easy reference (name:tag)

---

### 3. Running a Container Locally

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 physio-log-frontend:latest
```

- `docker run`: Start a new container
- `-p 3000:3000`: Map host port 3000 to container port 3000 (adjust ports as needed)
- `physio-log-frontend:latest`: Image name to create container from

---

### 4. Viewing Running Containers

```bash
docker ps
```

- Lists all currently running containers (use `docker ps -a` to see all containers, including stopped ones)

---

### 5. Stopping a Container

```bash
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```

- Stops a running container by ID or name

---

### 6. Removing a Container

```bash
docker rm <container_id_or_name>
```

- Deletes a stopped container to free resources

---

### 7. Pushing Image to Docker Registry

```bash
# Log in to Docker Hub (or your registry)
docker login

# Tag image for your Docker Hub repository
docker tag physio-log-frontend:latest yourdockerhubusername/physio-log-frontend:latest

# Push image to Docker Hub
docker push yourdockerhubusername/physio-log-frontend:latest
```

- Replace `yourdockerhubusername` with your actual Docker Hub username
- Registry hosts your image for sharing and deployment

---

### 8. Pulling Image from Docker Registry

```bash
docker pull yourdockerhubusername/physio-log-frontend:latest
```

- Downloads the image from the registry to your local machine

---

### 9. Multi-stage Build (Example for Smaller Production Image)

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20-alpine as build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve (using lightweight nginx)
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- Builds app in first stage, copies only build output to nginx image
- Results in smaller final image optimized for production

---

### üê≥ More on Multi-Stage Docker Build for Node.js

This Dockerfile demonstrates how to use a multi-stage build to create a lightweight, production-ready Node.js image while leveraging a full-featured environment during the build phase.

---

#### ‚úÖ Why Multi-Stage?

- üß∞ Use a full-featured image (`node:18`, based on Debian) to install and build everything.
- üßº Use a minimal image (`node:18-alpine`) for the final container ‚Äî smaller, faster, more secure.
- üéØ Only the final stage ends up in the production image.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è Example Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# ---------- Stage 1: Build Stage ----------
FROM node:18 as builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install all dependencies (including devDependencies)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the application (e.g., transpile TypeScript, compile assets)
RUN npm run build


# ---------- Stage 2: Production Stage ----------
FROM node:18-alpine as production

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the build output and production-related files
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production

# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

HOW IT WORKS:

- Docker builds both stages in sequence.
- builder stage compiles and installs everything, then production stage selectively copies only what's needed.
- The final image is based on Alpine Linux ‚Üí tiny and secure.
- You get the best of both worlds: full build power, minimal runtime size.

RESULTING IMAGE:

- No source files
- No dev dependencies
- No build tools
- Much smaller final image size (~50‚Äì100MB)
- Faster startup and safer deployment

BONUS TIPS:

- Add `USER` node in final stage to run as non-root.
- Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for deterministic installs (deletes node_modules if exists, always installs exact same versions of every package as in `package-lock.json` - no changes are made to it). Best practice is to use `npm install` in development and `npm ci` in CI/CD pipelines, Docker production builds or anywhere you want repeatable and clean installs
- Combine with `.dockerignore` to skip unnecessary files.

üõ†Ô∏è Updated Multi-Stage Dockerfile for Node.js using best practices:

```dockerfile
# ---------- Stage 1: Build ----------

FROM node:18 as builder

# Set working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first to leverage Docker layer caching

COPY package\*.json ./

# Clean, deterministic install of all dependencies (including dev)

RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the application source

COPY . .

# Build the application (e.g., transpile TypeScript, bundle React, etc.)

RUN npm run build

# ---------- Stage 2: Production ----------

FROM node:18-alpine as production

# Set working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies (you‚Äôll need these tools to run `npm ci`)

RUN apk add --no-cache curl && \
 addgroup -g 1001 nodeapp && \
 adduser -S -u 1001 -G nodeapp nodeapp

# Copy only production dependencies + built output from builder stage

COPY --from=builder /app/package\*.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

# Deterministic install of production dependencies only

RUN npm ci --only=production

# Use a non-root user for better security

USER nodeapp

# Start the application

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```
