### 1. Writing a Dockerfile: Base Structure

```Dockerfile
# Use a base image (specify Node version and distro)
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy app source code
COPY . .

# Build app (for React/Node frontends)
RUN npm run build

# Expose port (if running a server inside container)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start app (adjust depending on your app start script)
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

### 2. Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t physio-log-frontend:latest .
```

- `docker build`: Build Docker image from Dockerfile in current directory (`.`)
- `-t physio-log-frontend:latest`: Tag the image for easy reference (name:tag)

---

### 3. Running a Container Locally

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 physio-log-frontend:latest
```

- `docker run`: Start a new container
- `-p 3000:3000`: Map host port 3000 to container port 3000 (adjust ports as needed)
- `physio-log-frontend:latest`: Image name to create container from

---

### 4. Viewing Running Containers

```bash
docker ps
```

- Lists all currently running containers (use `docker ps -a` to see all containers, including stopped ones)

---

### 5. Stopping a Container

```bash
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```

- Stops a running container by ID or name

---

### 6. Removing a Container

```bash
docker rm <container_id_or_name>
```

- Deletes a stopped container to free resources

---

### 7. Pushing Image to Docker Registry

```bash
# Log in to Docker Hub (or your registry)
docker login

# Tag image for your Docker Hub repository
docker tag physio-log-frontend:latest yourdockerhubusername/physio-log-frontend:latest

# Push image to Docker Hub
docker push yourdockerhubusername/physio-log-frontend:latest
```

- Replace `yourdockerhubusername` with your actual Docker Hub username
- Registry hosts your image for sharing and deployment

---

### 8. Pulling Image from Docker Registry

```bash
docker pull yourdockerhubusername/physio-log-frontend:latest
```

- Downloads the image from the registry to your local machine

---

### 9. Multi-stage Build (Example for Smaller Production Image)

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20-alpine as build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve (using lightweight nginx)
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- Builds app in first stage, copies only build output to nginx image
- Results in smaller final image optimized for production

---

### 10. Helpful Docker Commands

| Command                               | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker images`                       | List all downloaded images                        |
| `docker logs <container>`             | View logs from running container                  |
| `docker exec -it <container> /bin/sh` | Open shell inside running container               |
| `docker system prune`                 | Clean up unused images/containers                 |
| `docker run -it <image>`              | Run container interactively (e.g. running ubuntu) |
